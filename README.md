Access Control Project, using ANPR for Optical Character Recognition(O.C.R)  using MySQL, rPI, Java, Python

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of: 11/12/2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionality includes:
  - Client Gui Application written on Java
  - Application uses Tesseract opensource Libraries to help with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for coverting Images to plain Text
  - Writes Characters to outputtes .txt File as well as sending to a specified mySQL database Server
  - All fucntionality stated above i working with possible minor flaws / kinks.

Functionality Includes:
  - working Java GUI executable from Jar file on a Windows OS
  - Image Plate Detection (Still Nedds tweaking, Nowhere near perfect)
  - process calling to a .exe program written in C++ from the java GUI which performs and Object Detect and Crop.
    This then feeds the image back into the Java GUI to perform the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract raw text from the     image

  Actvity Log:
-------------------------------------------------------
Been Trying to Build and Compile openCv to work on Linux OS on the rPi. Ive ran into countless issues and compatibility errors and    roughly 100 SD Cards, due to corruption and unknnown errors. This step has been the most time consuming leg of the project. it has been almost a month in progress and still have yet to succesfully execute a build using MAKE on linux and perform the install.
